In this project I have taken american airlines data from "Bureau of Transport Statistics" which keeps all the data related to transport in USA.
The dataset has flight booking data from January 2000 to October 2020. I have visualized air traffic from different locations, top 10 airline companies and routes. Then I have compared the impact of pandemic by comaring flight bookings and air traffic of the year 2019 and 2020.
